First of all, I am grateful to Allah for establishing me to finish this master thesis. In addition, I would like to thank to my advisers Professor Wen-Hsien, Fang and Professor Yie-Tarng, Chen for all the guidance. Their guidance has been essential  to me  as a budding researcher in computer vision and machine learning. Thank you for pushing me beyond my limit. It was both an honour and a great privilege to work with them.

Studying at NTUST was great for me. I was fortunate to have met brilliant students and wonderful friends, including EE 401-2 lab member, Bapel UT Taiwan, PCI Nahdlatul Ulama Taiwan, and Ngaji Bareng member. Also, my profound gratitude to 1-118 roommates — Adrian Chriswanto, Erick, Alrezza, Hilmil, Nizar, Billy, Farid, and also my partner — Rizard Purnomo, Kai, Her Long, Kevin and everyone who has not been mentioned for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and through the process of researching and writing this thesis. 

This journey would not have been possible without Google and StackOverflow, which always provide some suggestions when I got stuck on my work. Finally, I must express my deep gratitude to my parents, brother, and sister who always support me from Indonesia.  This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. Thank you.
